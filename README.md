Regarding ALG-PRACTICA_Ariadna.ipynb:

This is a practical exercise in algebra and geometry (use of arrays, matrices, dataframes, etc.) written in Python, my first assignment in the Pre-Bootcamp in Big Data with KeepCoding.
In this exercise, I work with different datasets and produce several multivariant linear models, based on two different methods: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Gradient Descent (GD). For both, I am programming the functions by hand, rather than using already-made algorithms. The results are then compared to those obtained using the sklearn.linear_model library.
Aside from calculating the coefficients of the linear regression, scatter graphs of the data together with the regression line are plotted, as a way to practice creating and personalizing graphs using the matplotlib.pyplot library.
Several Python libraries are used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.linear_model.
Throughout the code, I try to include comments to clarify the different steps. Because the course is in Spanish, I try to write the comments in Spanish, even though English comes more naturally to me, so there may be some mixing of languages.

Regarding Practica-AriadnaHeinz.qmd:

This is a practical exercise in statistics and datamining written in R using RStudio. It is my second assignment in the Pre-Bootcamp in Big Data with KeepCoding. 
In this exercise, I work with data from AirBnB rentals in the Madrid area. Many apartments are missing the value of the surface area. The goal of the exercise is to come up with a model that will help fill in the missing values and evaluate the model, and then of course to complete the dataset by using the model to fill in the missing values.
